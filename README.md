### Air Pollution (Expanded) 🏭🚗

Air pollution is the contamination of the Earth's atmosphere by various pollutants, often released from human activities and natural sources. These pollutants can include particulate matter, gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and other harmful substances. Air pollution poses significant environmental and health risks, contributing to issues like climate change, respiratory diseases, and ecosystem disruption. Addressing air pollution aligns with key sustainable development goals, including affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and partnerships to achieve these goals.

## Introduction 🌱🔍

Air pollution is a pressing global issue that affects both the environment and human well-being. In line with sustainable development goals, our college project aims to create a comprehensive website focused on promoting affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and fostering partnerships to achieve these goals. The website will serve as a valuable resource, providing information on the hazardous impacts of air pollution, government initiatives to combat it, innovative solutions, real-time air quality data, and historical pollution trends.

## Technologies Used 💻🔧

The proposed project will utilize various technologies and methods, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, XML, Postman API, Node.js, EJS (Embedded JavaScript), GitHub Pages, Bootstrap, Body Parser, Nodemon, Figma.

## API Usage 🌐📊

### OpenWeather API

This project utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve real-time air quality data and historical pollution information. The API allows users to search for air quality by city name, displaying results for various locations. In case of an error in the city name input, the website will handle and display appropriate error messages to guide the user.

## Expected Outcome 🌟📈

By the end of this project, we anticipate a fully functional website that not only raises awareness about air pollution but also promotes sustainable solutions in line with the keywords: affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and partnerships for a sustainable future. Users will have access to real-time air quality data and historical pollution information, contributing to a more informed and environmentally conscious society.
