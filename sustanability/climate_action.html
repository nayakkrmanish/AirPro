                    Climate change can impact air quality and, conversely, air quality can impact climate change.

                <h2>Climate Change Impacts on Air Quality</h2>
                <p>
                    Changes in climate can result in impacts to local air quality. Atmospheric warming associated with climate change has the potential to increase ground-level ozone in many regions, which may present challenges for compliance with the ozone standards in the future. The impact of climate change on other air pollutants, such as particulate matter, is less certain, but research is underway to address these uncertainties.
                </p>

                <h2>Air Quality Impacts on Climate Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emissions of pollutants into the air can result in changes to the climate.  These pollutants, including greenhouse gases, are often referred to as climate forcers. Ozone in the atmosphere warms the climate, while different components of PM can have either warming or cooling effects on the climate. For example, black carbon, a particulate pollutant from combustion, contributes to the warming of the Earth, while particulate sulfates cool the earth's atmosphere.

                  Clean energy access, especially in underdeveloped regions
                  facing energy poverty, enhances living conditions, education,
                  and economic growth. Technologies like solar panels and wind
                  turbines address the challenge of providing reliable energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scientific knowledge and tools developed by EPA are enhancing the ability of state and local air quality managers to consider climate change in their decisions to protect air quality and to reduce the impacts of a changing climate.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    EPA contributes to the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s development of the National Climate Assessment, including chapters on the impacts of climate on air quality. The Fourth National Climate Assessment was published in November 2018 and the Fifth National Climate Assessment is under development.

                    The majority of cookstoves used in developing countries emit black carbon, an air pollutant that contributes to warming of the atmosphere.
